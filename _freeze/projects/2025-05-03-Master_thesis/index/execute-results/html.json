Background\nMontane cloud forests (MCFs) are frequently immersed in low-altitude clouds or fog. The diurnal (defined as 07:00–16:50 local time) cycle of fog is particularly important for regulating the carbon, water and energy cycles of these ecosystems. Elevated temperatures may alter the spatiotemporal dynamics of fog and have cascading impacts on MCFs. Therefore, systematic monitoring of fog occurrence is essential for understanding the ramifications of climate change on these unique forests.\n\n### 2. Mathods\nThis study aims to quantify three years (2018–2020) of diurnal fog occurrence with high spatiotemporal (5 km, 10 minutes) resolutions in subtropical MCF in northeast Taiwan. **Four open-sky observation stations** were installed along an elevation gradient (1151, 1514, 1670 and 1811 m a.s.l.) within the cloud band to record meteorological data including **rainfall, air temperature and relative humidity**. We also acquired spatiotemporally-corresponding **photosynthetic photon flux density** from the geostationary **Himawari-8 satellite** and **derived solar zenith angle** for each station. We utilized these ground and satellite meteorological attributes to model fog occurrence using **seven machine learning methods**. By referring to **time-lapse images**, the performance of random forests was determined to be superior compared to other approaches and was therefore selected to quantify spatiotemporal dynamics of fog occurrence. \n\n### 3. Results\nFog was determined to be more abundant in terms of probability, frequency and duration in **mid-elevations** when compared to the lower and higher ends. Temporal analysis demonstrated that overall seasonality was pronounced with higher fog abundance in the afternoons and cold months but varied from station to station. In addition, three-year fog duration and event variability for each month were notable for all stations; the foggiest station was at 1670 m a.s.l. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using machine learning to quantify spatiotemporal dynamics of fog using cross-scale meteorological attributes, which may facilitate monitoring the impact of climate change on MCFs.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](fig.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.center-text .small-text}\nWith the power of machine learning models, we were able to estimate fog probability across time and space!

The beginning and the end of the variables are close to each other. \n\nIf you analyze these kinds of data as if they were normal linear variables (such as temperature, slope…), the results would be unexplainable.\n\nFor scientists in fields like ecology, geology, or geography, it is common to encounter circular variables. However, solutions for handling them are not widely discussed.\n\n#### Ways to handle circular variables\n\n##### 1. Classification\n\nThe most intuitive way is to classify the circular variables, allowing you to add classified variables into your linear models. \n\nFor example, direction data can be classified into 4 categories:\n\n- 0–45° → Class 1  \n- 45–90° → Class 2  \n- and so on.\n\n##### 2. Trigonometric function\n\nAnother method is to project the circular variables onto a unit circle and convert them to two-dimensional (x, y) variables. This maintains the cyclical nature of the original variables.\n\nExample in R using day of year from 1 to 365:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndoy_test <- c(1:365)\nde_doy <- 360 * doy_test / length(doy_test)  # Projecting to unit circle and showing as angle (deg)\nplot(sin(de_doy), cos(de_doy))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nHere, `sin(de_doy)` and `cos(de_doy)` become two new variables representing `doy_test`.\n\n#### Circular statistics\n\nIf you need to compute means or variances of circular variables, Pewsey et al. (2013) is a recommended read. The book also covers regression models for estimating circular variables.\n\nAdditionally, you can consider applying **Rayleigh and Watson Tests** on circular data.\n\n#### References\n- [Use of circular predictors in linear regression](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/148380/use-of-circular-predictors-in-linear-regression){target=\"_blank\"}\n- Pewsey, A., Neuhäuser, M., & Ruxton, G.
