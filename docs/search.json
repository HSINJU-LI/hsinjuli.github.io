    "text": "I’m currently a Ph.D. student in the Geography department at UC Santa Barbara.\nI earned both my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Geography from National Taiwan University (NTU). During my undergraduate years, I discovered a deep passion for being outdoors—hiking the trails around Taipei and observing the natural environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA typical day in Chilan, Taiwan. The photo shot from the top of a flux tower at 14.5K.\n\nOne class that particularly inspired me was Discovery of Montane Cloud Forests in Taiwan, which I took in my junior year. I was drawn to the idea that we could do science by combining indoor analysis with outdoor exploration. For my senior project, I conducted a study titled Analyzing the Factors of Windthrow by Typhoons in Chilan Mountain, using Landsat imagery and field measurements to investigate what environmental factors (e.g. slope, aspect, elevation etc.) contribute to higher windthrow risks in the montane forests of northern Taiwan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was measuring a really gigantic hinoki.\n\nThat early research experience led me to pursue a master’s degree under the guidance of my advisor, Choy Huang. My thesis, Assessment of Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Fog Daily Duration in Montane Cloud Forests of Northeast Taiwan, aimed to quantify fog frequency in montane cloud forests (MCFs) using Himawari-8 satellite imagery and meteorological field data. I used a random forest model to predict fog occurrence across both spatial and temporal scales. For a long time, our understanding of high-frequency fog in montane cloud forests (MCFs) was based mostly on rough estimates. My work was the first to quantify fog frequency in this ecosystem, laying the foundation for future studies on how these forests may be impacted by a warming climate.\nNow, as a Ph.D. student, my dissertation focuses on the impacts of drought on oak woodlands in Southern California. From working in environments with over 100% relative humidity to ecosystems where RH drops below 30%, I’ve found that what I enjoy most is the combination of remote sensing analysis and occasional fieldwork. My current research heavily involves imaging spectroscopy (a.k.a hyperspectral imagery), which captures over 300 bands across the electromagnetic spectrum, providing rich information about vegetation and ecosystem processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was observing a brunt oak tree.\n\nAs a first-generation college student, I feel incredibly fortunate to have been supported by mentors, friends, and advisors throughout my academic journey. Their guidance has helped me grow when I felt stuck or uncertain. I truly believe it takes a village to nurture a student into an independent scholar. Although I am still learning, I’d be more than happy to connect with anyone interested in pursuing a similar path in geography or environmental remote sensing."

    "text": "my hobby\nI believe that one of the most important skills to develop during a Ph.D. — beyond research — is maintaining a healthy work-life balance. A good balance not only supports well-being but also enhances productivity and creativity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutdoor Climbing in SB\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy running, climbing (mostly top-rope), teaching myself piano, solving Rubik’s cubes of different shapes, reading (Bible, sci-fi, self-improvement, environmental and political topics), playing board games, and hiking.\nSince Jan. 2024, I’ve been following a 3-day-a-week running plan, and in Nov. 2024, I finished the Santa Barbara Half marathon with my PB! I also started coordinating a graduate student running club in Fall 2024, helping to build a social and supportive community for fellow graduate students at UCSB.\nI began climbing in Fall 2022 and mostly climb at the UCSB Rec Center. Climbing has been incredibly rewarding — not just physically, but mentally. I’ve learned valuable life lessons from it. Sometimes I encounter a route that feels impossible. But with some trial and error, I often find that I can complete it a few weeks later. Most of us are capable of overcoming challenges that seem insurmountable at first — we just need the right techniques, a shift in perspective, and persistence. Climbing has taught me that many of the barriers we face are not real limits, but illusions.\nI only wish there were more hours in the day to enjoy all the things I love."
