    "text": "Abstract\n\n1. Background\nMontane cloud forests (MCFs) are frequently immersed in low-altitude clouds or fog. The diurnal (defined as 07:00–16:50 local time) cycle of fog is particularly important for regulating the carbon, water and energy cycles of these ecosystems. Elevated temperatures may alter the spatiotemporal dynamics of fog and have cascading impacts on MCFs. Therefore, systematic monitoring of fog occurrence is essential for understanding the ramifications of climate change on these unique forests.\n\n\n2. Mathods\nThis study aims to quantify three years (2018–2020) of diurnal fog occurrence with high spatiotemporal (5 km, 10 minutes) resolutions in subtropical MCF in northeast Taiwan. Four open-sky observation stations were installed along an elevation gradient (1151, 1514, 1670 and 1811 m a.s.l.) within the cloud band to record meteorological data including rainfall, air temperature and relative humidity. We also acquired spatiotemporally-corresponding photosynthetic photon flux density from the geostationary Himawari-8 satellite and derived solar zenith angle for each station. We utilized these ground and satellite meteorological attributes to model fog occurrence using seven machine learning methods. By referring to time-lapse images, the performance of random forests was determined to be superior compared to other approaches and was therefore selected to quantify spatiotemporal dynamics of fog occurrence.\n\n\n3. Results\nFog was determined to be more abundant in terms of probability, frequency and duration in mid-elevations when compared to the lower and higher ends. Temporal analysis demonstrated that overall seasonality was pronounced with higher fog abundance in the afternoons and cold months but varied from station to station. In addition, three-year fog duration and event variability for each month were notable for all stations; the foggiest station was at 1670 m a.s.l. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using machine learning to quantify spatiotemporal dynamics of fog using cross-scale meteorological attributes, which may facilitate monitoring the impact of climate change on MCFs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the power of machine learning models, we were able to estimate fog probability across time and space! Each column in the image represents each meteorological station."

In this case, the solar radiation would be divided into direct and diffuse radiation, which would be computed separately. Besides the SZA, sky clearness (affected by cloud, aerosol, water vapor etc.) also needs to be considered. The sky clearness index here, which was derived from satellite data, was one day resolution. The total solar radiation equals the sum of direct and diffuse radiation. From the formula above, we know that the accuracy of solar radiation depends largely on the accuracy of sky clearness index, which is also a common problem when it comes to satellite image processing. There are many methods to calculate solar radiation and SZA. The differences include how to compute local time, or the way to compute declination of earth (delta in above code) etc. These methods are subtle differences if your scale is not too fine.\n\nReferences\nBonan, G.

The beginning and the end of the variables are close to each other.\nIf you analyze these kinds of data as if they were normal linear variables (such as temperature, slope…), the results would be unexplainable.\nFor scientists in fields like ecology, geology, or geography, it is common to encounter circular variables. However, solutions for handling them are not widely discussed.\n\n\nWays to handle circular variables\n\n1. Classification\nThe most intuitive way is to classify the circular variables, allowing you to add classified variables into your linear models.\nFor example, direction data can be classified into 4 categories:\n\n0–45° → Class 1\n\n45–90° → Class 2\n\nand so on.\n\n\n\n2. Trigonometric function\nAnother method is to project the circular variables onto a unit circle and convert them to two-dimensional (x, y) variables. This maintains the cyclical nature of the original variables.\nExample in R using day of year from 1 to 365:\n\ndoy_test &lt;- c(1:365)\nde_doy &lt;- 360 * doy_test / length(doy_test)  # Projecting to unit circle and showing as angle (deg)\nplot(sin(de_doy), cos(de_doy))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, sin(de_doy) and cos(de_doy) become two new variables representing doy_test.\n\n\n\nCircular statistics\nIf you need to compute means or variances of circular variables, Pewsey et al. (2013) is a recommended read. The book also covers regression models for estimating circular variables.\nAdditionally, you can consider applying Rayleigh and Watson Tests on circular data.\n\n\nReferences\n\nUse of circular predictors in linear regression\nPewsey, A., Neuhäuser, M., & Ruxton, G.
