My research focuses on using both active and passive remote sensing data to monitor environmental changes across landscapes and through time.\nOutside of work, I’m an avid climber and runner who also enjoys playing board games with friends. I love trying new things and exploring new experiences!\nFeel free to poke around to learn more about me and my work!"

    "text": "I develop and teach data science training curricula for the Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, located at UC Santa Barbara. I am also a co-organizer of R-Ladies Santa Barbara, a local data science group which works to promote gender diversity in the R community.\n\nMy background is in marine ecology / ecophysiology – I had opportunities to study coral disease in Panama and the Florida Keys as an undergrad, then temperature effects on spiny lobster metabolism and foraging behavior in Santa Barbara for my Masters degree. Since the beginning of my time in STEM, I was totally terrified of all things data / coding / data science, but thanks to a super supportive community and some really rad colleagues / instructors, I found my new path in data science education and I absolutely love it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching MEDS students how to build their own personal websites using Quarto! This was especially fun for me, since Quarto was still such a new tool when I first gave this workshop – it meant a lot of discovery and learning on-the-fly alongside our students.\n\nI’m afforded a lot of flexibility in how I teach and what I teach. My focus is on developing and delivering workshop-style classes that supplement the MEDS core curriculum, though I’m now (as of Winter 2024) also teaching one of those core courses, EDS 240: Data Visualization & Communication (I reflect on building and teaching EDS 240 in this blog post). I teach primarily via live-coding (where my computer is hooked up to a screen for participants to see and hear me talk through code in real time as they follow along on their own computers) – this teaching style was invaluable in my own development as a data scientist, and I really believe that, when done well, live-coding can be a game-changing experience for early-career programmers. I am always looking for new ways to make my teaching style and materials more approachable and inclusive for all learners – I try to build my content to be stand-alone resources, both for participants to refer back to and also for those learning on their own time. Feel free to check out / reuse / recycle any of my workshop and course materials."
