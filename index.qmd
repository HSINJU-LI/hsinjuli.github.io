::: {#bio}
Hi, I’m Hsin-Ju Li!
I'm currently a Ph.D. student in the Geography Department at UC Santa Barbara. My research focuses on using both **active and passive remote sensing data** to monitor **environmental changes** across landscapes and through time.

Outside of work, I'm an avid **climber** and **runner** who also enjoys playing board games with friends. I love trying new things and exploring new experiences!

Feel free to poke around to learn more [about me](about.qmd) and my work!
